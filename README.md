# Real-Time_Audio_Synchronizor
This project enables real-time synchronization of audio playback across multiple devices connected to the same server. Users can upload audio files, which are then streamed and synchronized seamlessly on all connected devices. The system handles network latency dynamically to ensure near-perfect sync.
